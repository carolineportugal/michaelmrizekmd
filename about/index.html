          <p>With my background in various areas of psychiatry to including neuroscience, hospital consultation psychiatry and individual insight-oriented training and practice, I bring a well-rounded capability to my patientâ€™s individual needs. I couch my experience within an interactional style that is genuine and interested in the person rather than the diagnosis. </p>

          <p>The distinctive character of my practice is a product of my extensive training and experience in both medical and psychological psychiatry. While medication and other medical treatments are very useful, I have come to understand that psychotherapy is the most powerful vehicle for recovery and long term change in psychiatric care. </p>
